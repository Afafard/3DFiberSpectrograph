# Arms Subdirectory

This directory contains abstractions for controlling robotic arms, including:

- **Communication protocols** for interfacing with hardware controllers
- **Calibration routines** to ensure precise joint and end-effector positioning
- **Path planning algorithms** for smooth, collision-aware motion trajectories

All components are designed to be modular and hardware-agnostic.
